Before running the bot you have to create a file named "used.txt" in the same folder as the "scrape.py" file.
Then you have to create a file named "apidata.txt" in the same folder and have to put your API Data for Tweepy(Consumer_Key, Consumer_Key_Secret, Access_Token, Access_Token_Secret,Bot@) seperated by Commas with no space.
Then you can run the "scrape.py" script and enjoy your bot!
